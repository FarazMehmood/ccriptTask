To begin, make sure you have Yarn installed on your machine.
Running the Application:

Use the following command to run the application:
npx react-native run-android

Task Description
This report serves as a guide for the .readme file associated with the development of a mobile application for weight and height conversion using React Native. The application consists of two bottom tabs, "Hooks" and "MobX," each implementing a different state management approach.

Application Features
Tabs:

The application features two tabs, "Hooks" and "MobX," to showcase different state management methods.
Unit Conversion:

Within each tab, two input fields are provided for weight and height conversion:
Weight input supports pounds (lbs) and kilograms (kg).
Height input supports feet & inches (ft & inch) and meters (m).
The units displayed dynamically change based on the user's selection of Imperial or Metric units.
Automatic conversion between units is implemented.
"Save to Disk" Button:

The application includes a "Save to Disk" button, allowing users to store data locally on their device.
Persistent Data:

When the "Save to Disk" button is clicked, data is stored in a local file on the device.
Upon reopening the app, the stored data is read and displayed.
Implementation Details
Installation Instructions:


State Management:

The application showcases two different state management methods - React Context API and MobX.
Both state management methods use AsyncStorage for data storage.
User Interface:

The user interface of the application should be intuitive and user-friendly.
Provide clear indications of unit conversion and a user-friendly experience.
Conclusion
This mobile application for weight and height conversion demonstrates two different state management methods in React Native: React Context API and MobX. Additionally, it offers unit conversion functionality and data persistence using AsyncStorage. To get started, follow the installation and execution instructions provided above.

Thank you for your time and attention to this project.
